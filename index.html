    <h1>About me</h1>
      
    <p>Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet! My name is Madeline, 
      and I'm a senior in college, eagerly anticipating the next chapter of 
      my journey as I prepare to graduate in May of 2024.</p>
      
    <p>Throughout my academic career, I've pursued a passion for education 
      technology, more specifically learning technologies, delving into
      subjects that ignite my curiosity and challenge me to grow. Whether 
      it's been exploring the intricacies of learning technologies, digital 
      media studies, communication studies, or diving into extracurricular 
      activities such as Tech Ad-hoc Committee, You Matter Club, or Youth 4 
      Ethnic Studies, I've always sought to push myself beyond the confines 
      of the classroom. Here are a few projects that I've worked on:</p>

<h2>Senior Capstone</h2>
  <p>For my senior capstone, required by my communications minor, I took a 
    class titled <i>Media Outlaws</i> and I studied the hacktivist collect
    known as Anonymous. I chose to do a deep dive on one of their operations 
    known as Operation KKK or #opKKK. </p>

      <p>As I stand on the cusp of graduation, I'm excited to bring my blend 
        of academic knowledge, practical skills, and enthusiasm for learning 
        into the professional realm. I'm particularly drawn to opportunities 
        where I can practice instructional design skills. Whether it's through 
        internships, freelance projects, or full-time positions, I'm eager to 
        apply my skills and contribute meaningfully to the ed tech community 
        or the spirit of continued learning. </p>

      <p>Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I'm someone who bakes, 
        paints, crafts, sews quilts, reads, and goes for long walks. I believe 
        in the importance of maintaining a well-rounded life, where creativity, 
        curiosity, and connection with others play integral roles.</p>

      <p>This website serves as a platform to showcase my experiences, skills, 
        and interests. I invite you to explore further and get to know me 
        better. If you're interested in connecting or collaborating, don't

      <p>Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to what the future holds.</p>

      <p>With kindness, </p>

      <p>Madeline Malin</p>
